|mosaicSTR overview|

Usage
-----
To run mosaicSTR use the following command::

	mosaicSTR \
  	  --vcf <vcf file> \
  	  --out <string> \
  	  [filter options]

Required parameters:

* :code:`--vcf <VCF>` Input VCF file, generated by HipSTR. 
* :code:`--out <string>` Output file prefix. Use :code:`stdout` to print file to standard output

MosaicSTR will output a tab-delimited file with candidate mosaic STRs (mSTRs) either to stdout or to :code:`$out.tab`. See a description of the output file below.

Other general parameters:

* :code:`--region <string>`: Restrict to the region chr:start-end. VCF file must be bgzipped and indexed to use this option.
* :code:`--version`: Print the version of the tool

See `Example Commands`_ for examples running MosaicSTR under different settings.
